//! Core mesh components for the hyperactor framework.
//!
//! Provides [`Slice`], a compact representation of a subset of a
//! multidimensional array. See [`Slice`] for more details.
//!
//! This crate defines the foundational abstractions used in
//! hyperactor's mesh layer, including multidimensional shapes and
//! selection algebra. The crate avoids dependencies on procedural
//! macros and other higher-level constructs, enabling reuse in both
//! runtime and macro contexts.
